    <p class="description">One of my earliest memories of the internet was playing the Disney Fairies game called Pixie Hollow. The site had several mini-games and you could navigate the world as your own fairy avatar. There were several types of fairies you could choose from.</p>

    <div><p>Pixie Hollow included many mini-games that you could play by collecting items from around the game's environment. These items would be store in your "pouch." </p></div>
